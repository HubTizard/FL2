    "As explained in the notes, we can express a large compution by “chaining together” a sequence of functions that perform smaller computations using the (.) operator, e.g. f . g. This operation is particularly useful in the composition of map operations. A common style is to define a set of simple computations using map, and to compose them.\n",
