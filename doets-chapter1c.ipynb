    "prime numbers $p_1, \\ldots, p_j$ with the property that $p_1 \\ldots p_j = n$. We will show that a prime factorization of every natural number $n > 1$ exists by producing one by means of the following method of splitting off prime factors:\n",

To get some intuition about how the procedure works, let us see what it does for an example case, say $n = 84$. The original assignment to $n$ is called $n_0$; successive assignments to $n$ and $p$ are called $n_1$, $n_2, \\ldots$ and $p_1, p_2, \\ldots$. \n",

    "## 1.9 Haskell Equations and Equational Reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Haskell equations `f x y = ...` used in the definition of a function `f` are genuine mathematical equations. They state that the left hand side and the right hand side of the equation have the same value. This is *very* different from the use of `=` in imperative languages like C or Java. In a C or Java program, the statement `x = x*y` does not mean that `x` and `x ∗ y` have the same value, but rather it is a command to throw away the old value of `x` and put the value of `x ∗ y` in its place. It is a so-called *destructive assignment statement*: the old value of a variable is destroyed and replaced by a new one.\n",

E.g., after the Haskell declarations `x = 1` and `y = 2`, the Haskell declaration `x = x + y` will raise an error `\"x\" multiply defined`. Because `=` in Haskell has the meaning \"is by definition equal to\", while redefinition is forbidden, reasoning about Haskell functions is standard equational reasoning.\n",
