    "- Perform a computation on each element of a list : `map`\n",
    "- Iterate over a list, from left to right : `foldl`\n",

    "### Function composition\n",
    "As explained in the notes, we can express a large compution by \"chaining together\" a sequence of functions that perform smaller computations using the `(.)` operator, e.g. `f. g`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is particularly useful in the composition of `map` operations. A common style is to define a set of simple computations using `map`, and to compose them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following relationship is very useful to refactor your code:\n",
    "`map f (map g xs) = map (f . g) xs`\n",
    "\n",
    "This theorem is frequently used, in both directions. For example, if we want to take a list of numbers and perform two operations on each number, we could write:\n",
    "`map (+5) (map (*3) [1..10])`\n",
    "\n",
    "But we could equally write:\n",
    "`map ((+5) . (*3)) [1..10]`\n",

    "### Folding a list (reduction)\n",
    "An iteration over a list to produce a singleton value is called a `fold`. There are several variations: folding from the left, folding from the right, several variations having to do with \"initialisation\", and some more advanced variations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Folds may look tricky at first, but they are extremely powerful, and they are used a lot! And they aren't actually very complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left fold (`foldl`) processes the list from the left. Think of it as an iteration across a list, going left to right. A typical example is e.g. `foldl (\\acc elt -> elt:acc) \"\" \"Reversing a string\"` which unsurprisingly reverts a string.\n",
