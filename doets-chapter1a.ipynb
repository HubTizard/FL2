    "## 1.2 Implementing a Prime Number Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to implement a definition of prime number in a procedure that\n",
    "recognizes prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than\n",
    "$1$ that has no proper divisors other than $1$ and itself. The natural numbers are\n",
    "$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, \\ldots$ The list of prime numbers starts with $2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, \\ldots$ Except\n",
    "for $2$, all of these are odd, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n > 1$ be a natural number. Then we use $\\texttt{LD}(n)$ for the least natural number\n",
    "greater than $1$ that divides $n$. A number $d$ divides $n$ if there is a natural number $a$ with $a \\cdot d = n$. In other words, $d$ divides $n$ if there is a natural number $a$ with $\\frac n d = a$, i.e., division of $n$ by $d$ leaves no remainder. Note that $\\texttt{LD}(n)$ exists for every natural number $n > 1$, for the natural number $d = n$ is greater than $1$ and divides $n$. Therefore, the set of divisors of $n$ that are greater than $1$ is non-empty. Thus, the set will have a least element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following proposition gives us all we need for implementing our prime number\n",
    "test:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposition 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If $n > 1$ then $\\texttt{LD}(n)$ is a prime number.\n",
    "2. If $n > 1$ and $n$ is not a prime number, then $\\left(\\texttt{LD}\\left(n\\right)\\right)^2 \\leq n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the course of this book you will learn how to prove propositions like this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the proof of the first item. This is a proof by contradiction (see Chapter 3).\n",
    "Suppose, for a contradiction that $c = \\texttt{LD}(n)$ is not a prime. Then there are natural\n",
    "numbers $a$ and $b$ with $c = a \\cdot b$, and also $1 < a$ and $a < c$. But then $a$ divides $n$,\n",
    "and contradiction with the fact that $c$ is the smallest natural number greater than $1$\n",
    "that divides $n$. Thus, $\\texttt{LD}(n)$ must be a prime number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a proof of the second item, suppose that $n > 1$, $n$ is not a prime and that\n",
    "$p = \\texttt{LD}(n)$. Then there is a natural number $a > 1$ with $n = p \\cdot a$. Thus, $a$\n",
    "divides $n$. Since $p$ is the smallest divisor of $n$ with $p > 1$, we have that $p \\leq a$, and\n",
    "therefore $p^2 \\leq p \\cdot a = n$, i.e., $\\left(\\texttt{LD}(n)\\right)^2 \\leq n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operator $\\cdot$ in $a \\cdot b$ is a so-called *infix* operator. The operator is written *between* its arguments. If an operator is written *before* its arguments we call this *prefix* notation. The product of a and b in prefix notation would look like this: $\\cdot a b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In writing functional programs, the standard is prefix notation. In an expression `op a b`, `op` is the function, and `a` and `b` are the arguments. The convention is that function application associates to the left, so the expression `op a b` is interpreted as `(op a) b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using prefix notation, we define the operation `divides` that takes two integer\n",
    "expressions and produces a *truth value*. The truth values *true* and *false* are rendered in Haskell as `True` and `False`, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The integer expressions that the procedure needs to work with are called the *arguments* of the procedure. The truth value that it produces is called the *value* of the procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, $m$ divides $n$ if and only if the remainder of the process of dividing n\n",
    "by $m$ equals $0$. The definition of `divides` can therefore be phrased in terms of a predefined procedure `rem` for finding the remainder of a division process:\n"
